PROJECT DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

Train the facial recognition model with our faces
Capture videos and store in S3 (I think every 0.5 seconds)
Get response from each video uploaded
Updating DynamoDB with our information (name, major, and year)
Lambda functions to perform facial recognition from video and return the result (query DynamoDB and return name, major, and year)
Docker container part

def capture_and_send_to_S3:
	Capture video of 0.5 seconds using Python Pi camera module
	Send that video to S3
	Once it is processed, get the result from ____? (asynchronous)
	Or, synchronously 


def recognize_face_and_fetch_details(face_image_file):
	...
	Call eval face recognition module and get result
	Extract the details of the recognized person from the DynamoDB
	Return the details (name, major, year)


def download_video_from_S3(bucket, key):
	.
	.
	return ..

def process video:
	Input: 0.5 second video (.h264 format)
	To do:
	Extract frames
	Take the last frame and call recognize_face_and_fetch_details function
	Return the details (name, major, year)
